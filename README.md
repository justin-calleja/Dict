This module is just a wrapper around POJOs - plain old JS objects, allowing them to be concatenated together ([Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) is used for concatenation).

Install:

`npm i @justinc/dict -S`

See `repl.js` for example usage. Run REPL with `node repl.js`.
